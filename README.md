#Eye Project

This project is an example of my understanding of JavaScript concepts like arrays, function parameters, and loops. 

##To Run: 

Download source files from repository to root folder, and then open index.html in browser. 

##Future improvements: 

Next I would like to combine this concept with the Ball Movement excercise, so that the eyes follow a bouncing ball instead of the mouse!
