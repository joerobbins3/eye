# Eye Project

This project is an example of my understanding of JavaScript concepts like arrays, function parameters, and loops. 

## To Run: 

Download source files from repository to root folder, and then open [Index](https://github.com/joerobbins3/eye/blob/main/index.html) in browser. The eyes will then track your cursor as it moves about the screen!

## Future improvements: 

Next I would like to combine this concept with the Ball Movement excercise, so that the eyes follow a bouncing ball instead of the mouse!
